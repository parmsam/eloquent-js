# Asynchronicity
- In a synchronous programming model, things happen one at a time.
- An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time. 
    - When you start an action, your program continues to run. When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets access to the result (for example, the data read from disk).
