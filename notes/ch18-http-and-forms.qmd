# Protocol

## Request
- Here's an example of a simple HTTP request:

```{md}
GET /18_http.html HTTP/1.1 
Host: eloquentjavascript.net
User-Agent: Your browser's name
```

- The first line is the request line, which contains the method (GET), the path (/18_http.html), and the protocol version (HTTP/1.1).
    - Common methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. However, the server is not obliged to carry out every request it gets.

## Response

- Here's an example of a simple HTTP response:

```{md}
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 Content-Length: 87320
 Content-Type: text/html
 Last-Modified: Fri, 13 Oct 2023 10:05:41 GMT
```

- The first line is the status line, which contains the protocol version (HTTP/1.1), the status code (200), and the status message (OK).
    - Common status codes are 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).
    -  Status codes starting with a 2 indicate that the request succeeded. Codes starting with 4 mean there was something wrong with the request. Codes that start with 5 mean an error happened on the server and the request is not to blame.
- The first line of a request or response may be followed by any number of headers. These are lines in the form name: value that specify extra informa- tion about the request or response. 
    - The content-length and type tell us the size and type of the response document.
    - Without a Content-Type header in the response, the browser wonâ€™t know how to display the document.
